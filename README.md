# Deep-Learning-8-Siamese-and-Triplet-Networks

For this project I am using contrastive loss in order to create a siamese network.

Siamese networks use two identical networks (shared weights) to minimize the difference between similar inputs and maximize differnece between dissimilar inputs.
*Please contact me for the dataset*

--> Visualize.py as the start file

*Generated the embeddings of the test digits and each color plots points with respect to class*

Triplet Networks are identical networks (3) which receive three images at a time during training. The first image belongs to a different class from the middle imageand third images.
