# Deep-Learning-8-Siamese-and-Triplet-Networks

For this project I am using contrastive loss in order to create a siamese network.

Siamese networks use two identical networks (shared weights) to minimize the difference between similar inputs and maximize differnece between dissimilar inputs.

--> Visualize.py as the start file
